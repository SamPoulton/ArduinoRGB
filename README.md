# LuminanceRGB
Luminance is another RGB platform, originally designed for use inside computers but will work with anything. It's designed to be a simple and user-friendly way to control RGB lights, but also open and easily customisable to fit your needs. Here the system is implemented with C# and an Arduino, but the underlying protocol is open and available on the wiki for anyone to implement.

## Working Devices
Currently, the program in the LuminanceClient project runs on:
* Arduino (tested on an Uno and a Mega2560)
