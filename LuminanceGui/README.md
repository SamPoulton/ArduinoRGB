# LuminanceRGB
Luminance is an RGB platform, originally designed for use inside computers but will work with anything. It's designed to be a simple, resource-friendly and user-friendly way to control RGB lights, but also open and easily customisable to fit your needs. It doesn't need to constantly run on your system, and as a result uses very little CPU time and resources. Here the system is implemented with C# and an Arduino, but the underlying protocol is open and available on the wiki for anyone to implement.

## Working Devices
Currently, the program in the LuminanceClient project runs on:
* Arduino (tested on an Uno and a Mega2560) (note that ESP8266 doesn't work currently)
